# Apache Log Translator

This repository contains tools used for generating synthetic Apache logs and the tools needed to parse reference empirical logs, see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06320) "On Automatic Parsing of Log Records" for details. 

## Apache Fake Log Generator

For the Apache Fake Log Generator tool, please see the `./generator/` folder. A complete description of how to use the tool in the `./generator/README.md` file.

## Real Log Converter

For the tool used to parse real logs V<sub>A</sub>, V<sub>B</sub>, and V<sub>C</sub> , and convert them into a format ingestible by a machine learning model, please see the `./real_log_cleaner` folder. The origins of the logs are as follows: [V<sub>A</sub>](https://github.com/ocatak/apache-http-logs/blob/b7713f88368443501a296a6adda06475d491d6fb/netsparker.txt), [V<sub>B</sub>](https://github.com/ocatak/apache-http-logs/blob/b7713f88368443501a296a6adda06475d491d6fb/acunetix.txt), and [V<sub>C</sub>](https://github.com/elastic/examples/blob/bc53b584c0f9f574d4373193334bf03541a54936/Common%20Data%20Formats/apache_logs/apache_logs). Additional details are given in `./real_log_cleaner/README.md` file.

## Sample Logs Used

To view all of the sample log files used (including the three real log files, as well as the five generated log files mentioned in the paper), please visit the [data repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4536514).

## Publication

The details of the tool and the data are given in a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06320). The final version of the paper was [published](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-NIER52604.2021.00017) in proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSEâ€™21); you can see the recording of the presentation [here](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icse-2021/icse-2021-New-Ideas-and-Emerging-Results/14/On-Automatic-Parsing-of-Log-Records).
